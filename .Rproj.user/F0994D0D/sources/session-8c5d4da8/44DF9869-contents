# Conclusion: The ANOVA test assesses if there are significant differences in the number of cases between countries.
# If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.
# If the p-value is low, it suggests that at least one country has a significantly different number of cases.
# The bar chart visually shows the distribution of cases, and the ANOVA result helps confirm if there are significant differences.
