# GENDER
# Let's check the significance of the gender (male/female) on the rate of death among patients
# In other words, is gender a significant factor in the probability of death or suvival?

# let's sort the dataset into two categories (subsets): men and women:
men = subset(filtered_data, gender == "male")
women = subset(filtered_data, gender == "female")

# Let's calculate the probability of death for each category, taking advantage of the fact that
# the variable death_B is Boolean, though it is represented as an integer (zero or one)
# and zero means the impossible event of death (i.e., survived), while one represents the certain 
# event (i.e., death):
mean(men$death_B, na.rm = TRUE) # output: probability of death among men is: 0.085
mean(women$death_B, na.rm = TRUE) #output: probability of death among men is: 0.037

# is this statistically significant?
# Let's run the T-Test, with a confidence of 99%:
t_test_gender <- t.test(men$death_B, women$death_B, alternative="two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
print(t_test_gender)

# Conclusion: With a 99% confidence: men have from 0.8% to 8.8% higher chance
# of dying.
# p-value = 0.002 < 0.05, so, this is statistically
# significant
